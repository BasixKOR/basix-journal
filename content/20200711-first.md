# Moving blog, again
Yeah I know, I'm moving again. but trust me, this place will be *the place* for my upcoming articles.

# But you don't write
Well I'm trying to change that, so I got some plans! [Evan Moon's post (ko)](https://evan-moon.github.io/2019/09/28/how-do-i-write-postings/) inspired this plan a lot, so I'd like to thank him first.

- Start with easy concepts

  I think by far this is most important for my writings. I was bit hesitant to write something that many of people are already familar with, but the posting above encouraged me to express my knowledge without worrying about it.

- Translating existing articles

  Well this only applies to the Korean blog, but I'm planning to translating other English articles to Korean. Probably this will be posted if I have no idea what to write.
