People often think choosing React means choosing development experience over perfomance. While this statement isn't really true, there is a simple way to get awesome development experience and great perfomance for free.

# But why should I learn _yet another JavaScript framework_?
Calm down, It isn't new. It has been around since 2015, and it has *almost* same API with React and compatibility layer for React! So you can keep using your favourite React libraries and existing codebase while using Preact.
